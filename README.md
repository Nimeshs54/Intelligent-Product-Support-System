# ðŸ§  Intelligent Product Support System

An end-to-end AI-driven support assistant that learns from 100,000+ historical tickets to:

- **Understand** incoming tickets (categorization, sentiment, priority).
- **Retrieve** relevant solutions from past resolutions and documentation (RAG + graph).
- **Detect** anomalies (emerging issues, spikes, sentiment shifts).
- **Learn** continuously from agent actions and feedback.

This project is designed as a **full-stack AI system**: from data ingestion â†’ model training â†’ retrieval â†’ monitoring â†’ API â†’ demo UI.  
It is fully containerized so recruiters or engineers can reproduce results with a single command.
